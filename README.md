 <h2 id="1">What is neuroscience?</h2>

 **Neuroscience** (or neurobiology) is the scientific study of the nervous system. It is a *multidisciplinary* branch of biology that combines physiology, anatomy, molecular biology, developmental biology, cytology, mathematical modeling and psychology to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of *neurons* and *neural circuits*.(from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience "an introduction of neuroscience"))
